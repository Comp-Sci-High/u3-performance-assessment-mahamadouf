Why did you pick this API topic?

Initially, I didn't know what I wanted to work on for this performance assignment like every other so I asked chatGPT and picked the first one it sent back. It seems pretty easy and someday I might improve this similar to Mr Castro's weather API with different countries and building on my current API.

Describe your API and the available data endpoints

My API has different cities and depending on the city, the weather differs. With the weather, I've added different weather functions like humidity and precipation. Additionally, I added different states and there is information on the states like when they became a state, a fun fact and what state number it is. I'm working through having a dynamic path parameter so you could have any state or city available and see their data respectively. You could use /api/states/ input a state here or /api/cities/ input a city here to see the weather or information on the state or city

How was your experience building your own API server after using other APIs as a client in Unit 2?

My experience building my API server is fairly simple and with adding dynamic path parameters, it'll make it a lot more simpler. But if I were to not add dynamic path parameters then it'll be similar to the others with data just popping up.
